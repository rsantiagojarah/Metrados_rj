// executor: `ship` carried the procedure in a paragraph under "park/discard", the block that runs on
// a direct merge never mentioned it, and nothing at all fired when the merge happened in the forge.
// So worktrees accumulated, and a list where live work and landed work look identical is a list
// nobody can act on — least of all the non-technical profile the harness claims to serve.
//
// This module owns the one judgement that must never be made by feel: *can this be removed without
// asking?* Three questions decide it, and every one of them fails towards keeping the directory:
//
//   provenance  — did rsc create it? (derived from the content, never from a registry: P3)
//   integration — does the branch still carry anything the trunk does not have?
//   contents    — is there anything inside that was never in git and cannot be regenerated?
//
// Imported by `.rsc/session-start.mjs` (the sweep) and by `scripts/rsc.js` (`rsc worktrees`), so the
// rule exists once and both entry points cannot drift apart. Same shape as `sello.mjs`.
